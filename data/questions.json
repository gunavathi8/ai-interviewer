    "question": "What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it used?",
    "answer_key": "A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope's variables even after the outer function has returned. It’s used for data privacy and creating function factories.",

    "question": "Explain the difference between var, let, and const.",
    "answer_key": "var is function-scoped and allows redeclaration; let is block-scoped and allows reassignment; const is block-scoped and prevents reassignment after initialization.",

    "topic": "Machine Learning",
    "question": "What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented?",
    "answer_key": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in the training data, reducing generalization. It can be prevented using regularization, cross-validation, or more training data.",

    "question": "What is gradient descent, and how does it work?",
    "answer_key": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a loss function by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. It adjusts parameters based on the learning rate.",

    "question": "What are list comprehensions in Python?",
    "answer_key": "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using a single line of code, often replacing loops. For example, `[x**2 for x in range(5)]` generates `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]`.",

    "id": "py2",
    "topic": "Python",
    "question": "Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.",
    "answer_key": "A list is mutable, allowing modifications after creation, while a tuple is immutable and cannot be changed. Lists use square brackets `[]`, and tuples use parentheses `()`.",

    "question": "What is a decorator in Python, and how is it used?",
    "answer_key": "A decorator is a function that wraps another function to extend its behavior without modifying its code. It’s used for tasks like logging or access control, often with the `@` syntax.",

  {
    "id": "py4",
    "topic": "Python",
    "question": "How does Python handle memory management?",
    "answer_key": "Python uses automatic memory management with a garbage collector that tracks objects and frees memory when objects are no longer referenced. It employs reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector for memory efficiency.",
