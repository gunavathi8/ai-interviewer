    "question": "What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it used?",
    "answer_key": "A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope's variables even after the outer function has returned. It’s used for data privacy and creating function factories.",

    "question": "What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented?",
    "answer_key": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise in the training data, reducing generalization. It can be prevented using regularization, cross-validation, or more training data.",

    "question": "What is gradient descent, and how does it work?",
    "answer_key": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a loss function by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. It adjusts parameters based on the learning rate.",

    "question": "What are list comprehensions in Python?",
    "answer_key": "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using a single line of code, often replacing loops. For example, `[x**2 for x in range(5)]` generates `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]`.",
