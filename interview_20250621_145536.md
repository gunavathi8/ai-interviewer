# Interview Summary for Nlp (20250621_145536)

## Question 1
**Question**: What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization in Natural Language Processing? (Easy)
**Answer**: stemming reduces words to their root form, aften resulting in non-words while lemmatization uses dictionary to convert words to thier base form with proper context
**Score**: 7/10
**Feedback**: The candidate correctly identifies that stemming results in non-words and that lemmatization involves dictionary use, but lacks detail on how stemming works and does not mention the importance of context in lemmatization. Overall, the answer is accurate but could benefit from clearer explanations and examples.

## Question 2
**Question**: What is the purpose of tokenization in Natural Language Processing? (Easy)
**Answer**: it breaks text into smaller units like words or sentences, allowing machines to process and analyze language more effectively
**Score**: 7/10
**Feedback**: The answer accurately describes tokenization and its purpose, mentioning the breakdown of text into smaller units and its role in enabling machine processing. However, it lacks some depth by not mentioning specific types of tokens or the further processing tasks that tokenization enables, such as parsing and feature extraction.

## Question 3
**Question**: What is the role of stop words in Natural Language Processing? (Easy)
**Answer**: it is a noise and of no use
**Score**: 3/10
**Feedback**: The answer identifies stop words as noise, which is somewhat accurate, but it lacks clarity and depth. It does not provide examples or explain why these words are filtered out, which is essential for a complete understanding of their role in Natural Language Processing.

## Question 4
**Question**: What is word embedding in Natural Language Processing, and why is it important? (Easy)
**Answer**: i am not aware sorry
**Score**: 0/10
**Feedback**: The candidate's response indicates a lack of knowledge regarding stop words in Natural Language Processing, which is a fundamental concept. There is no accuracy, clarity, or depth in the answer provided.

## Question 5
**Question**: What is Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Natural Language Processing? (Easy)
**Answer**: sorry i am not sure on this topic
**Score**: 0/10
**Feedback**: The response indicates a complete lack of knowledge on the topic, which is not acceptable for a technical interview. There is no accuracy, clarity, or depth demonstrated in the answer.

## Final Summary
**Average Score**: 3.57
**Summary**: The candidate demonstrated some strengths in accurately describing concepts related to stemming, tokenization, and word vectors, but overall performance was lacking in depth and clarity. Significant gaps in knowledge regarding stop words and Named Entity Recognition were evident, resulting in low scores for those questions. The average score of 3.57 reflects a need for improvement in both foundational knowledge and the ability to articulate concepts more clearly.
